Mingle Sonar Plugin
===================
Plugin for Sonar that adds a widget to display the number of defects for a project in Mingle. The number of defects is
determined by a search that will return defect cards that match the given "component" property. That means that when a
defect is identified, it is important to set the "component" property of the defect card to the project that caused the defect.
